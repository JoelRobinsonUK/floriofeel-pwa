                            <p>The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In
                                ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite.[19][20] In
                                the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the
                                rose"[21][19] and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying
                                that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms".[22][19] The second-century AD Greek
                                travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the
                                rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the
                                flower red with her blood.[23][19] Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass
                                by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus,
                                instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat
                                rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in
                                order to regain his humanity.[20]

                                Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the
                                Virgin Mary. The color of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic
                                representation.[24][25][20] The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary
                                and other devotional prayers in Christianity.[26][20]

                                supporters of the rival factions in the Wars of the Roses pick either red or white roses

                                Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the
                                Blessed Virgin Mary.[20] In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of
                                sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens.[20] Albrecht Dürer's
                                painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of
                                roses to her worshippers.[20]

                                Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the
                                Roses.

                                Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as
                                ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist
                                Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly
                                roses.

                                Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers
                                including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.

                                Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have
                                paintings of roses among their works.

                                In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose[27] the floral
                                emblem of the United States.[28] </p>
